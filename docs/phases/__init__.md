## Description
The code snippet imports the `os` and `sys` modules and appends the current working directory to the `sys.path`. This allows the program to access modules and packages located in the current working directory.

## Imports

- `os`: The `os` module provides a way to interact with the operating system. It provides various functions for file and directory operations, environment variables, and more.
- `sys`: The `sys` module provides access to some variables used or maintained by the interpreter and to functions that interact with the interpreter. It provides functions and variables related to the Python system and runtime environment.

## Usage
The `sys.path.append(os.getcwd())` statement is used to add the current working directory to the system path. This is useful when you want to import modules or packages located in the current working directory.

Note that this code snippet assumes that the current working directory contains the modules or packages you want to import. If the modules or packages are located in a different directory, you may need to modify the code accordingly.
