<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

During the spring term in my freshman year of university, I took a Computer Science class where I learned how to code in Python. After passing that class, I decided that I like coding enough to pick it up as a hobby. One project that I wanted to do on the side was to create a program that would print out the grades I currently have. At the time, some of the professors don't update the grades in my university's SIS system so I took it upon myself to do it.
